# Release

We use [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to package and distribute the application. Which makes really easy doing that.

1. Merge the changes to the main branch.
1. On GitHub, open the Build action for the last commit and test the app, it will have uploaded the artifacts for each OS.
1. Once you confirm the app is working as expected, then it is time to start the release process.
1. Run `npm version <major|minor|patch>` based on the level of the changes being deployed. It will set a new version in the package.json and also create a new git tag for that.
1. Run `git push --follow-tags` to push those changes to GitHub.
1. Create a new release for that version at https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/releases. Don't forget to set the release title and the description with all the changes. **DO NOT CREATE A DRAFT RELEASE, PUBLISH IT DIRECTLY**, it won't trigger the Release action to upload the artificats because of [this issue](https://github.community/t/workflow-set-for-on-release-not-triggering-not-showing-up/16286/10).
1. Once the release is created, the GitHub Release action will upload the artifacts for that build.
1. Once the release artifacts have been uploaded, then update [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-a-cask).
